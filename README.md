# Introduction

A MERN stack app that recreates the classic game Mastermind!

Users will have to try and guess the secret color combination by using the hints given after each guess. Solid circle means that a peg is in the correct location. A bold outline of a circle means that the correct color was guessed, but in the wrong location. A blank circle means that the color is not part of the combination.
